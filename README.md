#Preloader with Fade-out Effect and Styled Content

This project is a simple HTML page featuring a preloader that displays a spinner while the page loads. Once the page is fully loaded, the preloader fades out smoothly, revealing the main content.
The main content includes various sections with styled headings and paragraphs, demonstrating basic text styling using CSS. 
This project is a good example of how to enhance user experience with a preloader and elegant text styling.
